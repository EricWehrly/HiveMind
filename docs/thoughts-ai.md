Maybe all buildings should be able to build other buildings
    and nodes should just add 'thinking power' to the hivemind...

- There should be one aggregate AI for the entire hivemind
    (we went down this road before, we need to document why we do / don't)
- Each player entity should have a volume (size) with a min and max
    as well as 'stomach contents' for digestion
    the volume should increase as contents are digested
    the current volume should also dictate the maximum size of external objects that can be consumed for digestion
- Each thing in the world should have an associated rate of digestion
    which increases as player characters become more familiar with it
- Things like 'eater' slimes should target the highest rate of digestion things first


Rather than a broad Ai, each 'node' (or structure) should only be able to think about either 
    doings it's job, or building another node 
    Until whichever it chooses has finished, and it can reconsider
