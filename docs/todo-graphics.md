we need to set up a whole "layered renderer" thing (like in monolith)
to be able to draw in canvas
to be able to try some of the shader stuff we wanted to mess with

menu items should have a padding when not selected
    so that they don't adjust their vertical position when selected

- Camera controls & following player
    rendering controller or something for other entities
    smooth movement? tweening? speed and accel?
    when player faces a direction, the camera should "shift" in that direction, such that the player is off-center on the screen, with the 'peeked' direction taking some amount

- Maybe spawner building should look wide and short
