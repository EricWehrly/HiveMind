- self-thinking
    1. self-select where to place building
    2. determine which building to build

- player queues desired build    

- self-defense
    - spawn little attack forms to defend itself
        (use what we can from spawning eating guys)
    - spawn structures that attack enemies
    - (much later) spawn walls (dumb structures made of stiff material)
