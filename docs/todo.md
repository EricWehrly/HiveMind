- set up a map object or some mechanism for spawning new entities as the player explores around

- Camera controls & following player
    rendering controller or something for other entities
    smooth movement? tweening? speed and accel?
    when player faces a direction, the camera should "shift" in that direction, such that the player is off-center on the screen, with the 'peeked' direction taking some amount

- setting up player structures with purposes

- time to try networking with webrtc signal and turn ... can probably just stand up a docker on localhost for now
